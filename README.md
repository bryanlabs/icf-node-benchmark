## üéØ ICF Application Optimizations

Based on your feedback about needing event indexing, week-long data retention, and heavy usage of `GetTxResponse`, `GetTxResponsesForEvent`, and `BankQueryBalance` endpoints, we've made specific optimizations to ensure optimal performance for your application.

### 1. **Event Indexing Support** ‚úÖ
**Your Need:** "We rely on event indexing as well"

**Our Optimization:**
```toml
# Targeted event indexing for applications
index-events = [
  "message.action", "message.sender", "message.module",
  "transfer.recipient", "transfer.sender", "transfer.amount",
  "coin_spent.spender", "coin_received.receiver", "coin_received.amount"
]
```

**Why:** We've specifically configured indexing for the most common type of events applications need most, focusing on transfers, message routing, and balance changes rather than indexing everything. These optimizations can be adjusted as needed - see [Future Optimization Opportunities](#-future-optimization-opportunities) below for additional customization options.

### 2. **Week-Long Data Retention** ‚úÖ
**Your Need:** "Would be great if we could retain a week of data"

**Our Optimization:**
```toml
# Custom pruning for 1-week retention (chain-specific)
pruning = "custom"
pruning-keep-recent = 604800  # 1 week at 1s blocks = 604,800 blocks
pruning-interval = 5000       # Optimized for fast block times
min-retain-blocks = 604800

# For slower chains (6s blocks):
pruning-keep-recent = 100800   # 1 week at 6s blocks = 100,800 blocks
pruning-interval = 1000        # Less frequent pruning needed
```

**Why:** We pre-calculated exact block retention by analyzing the last 1000 blocks for each chain to determine average block times. Fast chains (1s blocks) need 604,800 blocks for one week, while slower chains (6s blocks) only need 100,800 blocks. This ensures precise 7-day data retention regardless of chain speed.

### 3. **Optimized for Your Heavy-Use Endpoints** ‚úÖ
**Your Need:** "We use three endpoints heavily: GetTxResponse, GetTxResponsesForEvent, and BankQueryBalance"

**Our Optimizations:**

**For GetTxResponse (Transaction Lookups):**
```toml
# Faster transaction queries
inter-block-cache = true
iavl-cache-size = 3000000  # Optimized for 1s blocks
```

**For GetTxResponsesForEvent (Event-based Queries):**
```toml
# Faster event queries with proper indexing
query-gas-limit = 2000000000  # Handle complex event queries
# + Event indexing configuration above
```

**For BankQueryBalance (Balance Queries):**
```toml
# IAVL optimizations for state queries
iavl-disable-fastnode = false  # Keep fastnode for faster balance lookups
iavl-lazy-loading = false      # Immediate loading for faster queries
```

### 4. **Addressing Performance Issues** ‚úÖ
**Your Problem:** "We've had issues with lagging nodes and general downtime"

**Our Optimizations:**

**Mempool Optimization:**
```toml
[mempool]
max-txs = 15000  # Enable mempool with higher capacity (was disabled by default)
```

**Network Performance:**
```toml
# Fast chains (1s blocks) - optimized for high throughput
send_rate = 5120000
recv_rate = 5120000
timeout_broadcast_tx_commit = "30s"

# Slower chains (6s blocks) - conservative settings
send_rate = 2048000
recv_rate = 2048000
timeout_broadcast_tx_commit = "60s"
```

**Connection Management:**
```toml
# Optimized for your current needs with room for growth
max_subscription_clients = 100  # Ready for future streaming
max_open_connections = 2000     # Handle heavy API usage
experimental_close_on_slow_client = true  # Prevent degradation
```

## üöÄ Future Optimization Opportunities

### Range Query Enhancement

**Current Status:** Infrastructure uses optimized exact height queries achieving <50ms response times.

**For Advanced Use Cases:** If applications require range queries (`tx.height>X`), we can implement targeted optimizations. Several strategies available:

1. **IAVL Cache Tuning** - Immediate performance boost
2. **PostgreSQL Indexer** - Dramatic improvement for range queries
3. **Selective Event Indexing** - Reduced index size optimization
4. **Resource Scaling** - Enhanced compute if needed

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

Please let us know if you notice any issues or want different tuning - we'll update ASAP. We're confident that our deep knowledge of the Cosmos SDK and ability to iterate fast will ensure you're always able to query the data you need on the node in a timely manner that's always available.

## üß™ Benchmark Tool - Validation & Testing

As part of your delivery, we've included a custom benchmark tool that validates the performance optimizations and confirms your infrastructure is operating at peak efficiency.

### What the Benchmark Tests

Based on your application requirements:

1. **Data Retention** - Confirms 1+ week of historical blockchain data availability
2. **GetTxResponse** - Individual transaction lookup latency and functionality
3. **GetTxResponsesForEvent** - Event-based query performance + indexing verification
4. **BankQueryBalance** - Account balance query response times
5. **Event Indexing** - Validates application-relevant events are properly indexed
6. **Protocol Coverage** - Tests RPC, REST API, and GRPC endpoints

### Using the Benchmark Tool

**Prerequisites:**
- **Go 1.23+** - [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- **Git** - For cloning the repository

**Installation & Usage:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bryanlabs/icf-node-benchmark
cd icf-node-benchmark

# Install dependencies
make install

# Configuration is already included in the repository

# Build the benchmark tool
make build

# Test individual chains (must be configured in config.yaml)
./benchmark neutron
./benchmark dydx
./benchmark pryzm

# Test all enabled chains
./benchmark all

# Or run directly with Go
go run benchmark.go all
```

**Configuration:**

The benchmark tool uses the included `config.yaml` file which defines:
- **Chain endpoints** (RPC, API, GRPC, WebSocket URLs)
- **Block times** (pre-calculated from chain analysis)
- **Performance thresholds** (pass/warn/fail criteria)
- **Chain-specific optimizations** (SDK versions, query styles)
